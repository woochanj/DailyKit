    "whyTestDesc": "Whether you've just bought a new monitor, laptop, or smartphone, or you're troubleshooting an old one, verifying your screen's health is crucial. Manufacturing defects like dead pixels or backlight bleeding can affect your viewing experience. Our <b>Display Test</b> tool helps you identify these issues quickly and easily directly from your browser, with no software installation required.",
    "deadVsStuckTitle": "Dead vs. Stuck Pixels",
    "deadVsStuckDesc": "<b>Dead Pixels</b> are pixels that fail to light up, appearing as black dots on a bright background. They are usually permanent hardware faults.\n\n<b>Stuck Pixels</b> are pixels frozen in a specific color (Red, Green, or Blue). Unlike dead pixels, stuck pixels can sometimes be fixed by rapidly flashing colors over the area, which forces the liquid crystal to reset.",
    "backlightTitle": "Backlight Bleeding",
    "backlightDesc": "Backlight bleeding occurs when light from the monitor's backlight leaks around the edges of the screen. It is most visible when viewing dark scenes in a dimly lit room. Use our <b>Black Screen Test</b> (the first color in the cycle) to check for uneven brightness along the bezels of your display.",
